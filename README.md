# Data Analysis on Diabetes Data Set
### Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis

Dataset - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)



The goal of data analysis on this dataset is often to understand patterns and relationships within the data and gain insights into factors that may contribute to the development of diabetes.
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration in a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: Age in years.
Outcome: The target variable, where 1 indicates the presence of diabetes, and 0 indicates no diabetes.
